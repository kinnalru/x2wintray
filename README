			STAnd aLONE TRAY


DESCRIPTION: the stalonetray is a STAnd-aLONE system TRAY (notification area).
It has minimal build and run-time dependencies: the Xlib only. The XEMBED
support is planned. Stalonetray runs under virtually any window manager.

To start using stalonetray, just copy stalonetrayrc.sample to ~/.stalonetrayrc.
It is well-commented and should suffice for a quick start. Since 0.3 we have a
pretty manpage. In case of problems, do not hesitate to contact the author
directly.

BUILD-DEPS: Xlib, libc, cc. 

LICENSE: GPL (see COPYING).

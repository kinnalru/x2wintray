- Remote control. Now it is possible to execute clicks on icons windows from
  command line. See documentation on --remote-click option for more info

- Support for window struts EWMH property: now maximized windows do not cover
  stalonetray window. See documentation on --window-strut option for more info.

- In addition to --icon-size which defines default icon size, now there is also
  a --slot-size which defines size of slot containing an icon.

- Initial and maximal tray window dimensions are now specified in slot_size
  multiples

  --scrollbars option for more info. This feature is experimental.

- Semi-ugly support for WindowMaker dockapp mode. See documentation on
  --dockapp-mode option for more info.

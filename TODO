- sanitize x11 calls: check return values instead of relying on x11_ok() whenever possible
- track size changes of the icons that failed to fit into the tray
- rework root transparency code (handle cases when root pmap size is less than root window; take implementation from urxvt)
- restructure command line params and reduce their count
